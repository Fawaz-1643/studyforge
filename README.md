# StudyForge

StudyForge is a dark-mode university study planner built one small milestone at
a time. This repository currently contains **Milestone 1: the project
foundation**.

No planner features have been implemented yet. The timer, course-linked tasks,
local persistence, statistics, and XP system belong to later milestones.

## What Milestone 1 includes

- A React application powered by Vite
- A polished, responsive dark-mode welcome screen
- A production build that works with Vercel
- A `.gitignore` that keeps generated and personal files out of Git
- A small, beginner-friendly folder structure

## Run the project locally

You need a current version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.

1. Open a terminal in this project folder.
2. Install the project's packages:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the local development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open the local address printed in the terminal, usually
   `http://localhost:5173`.
5. Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal when you want to stop the server.

Vite automatically refreshes the page when you save a code change.

## Useful commands

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run dev` | Starts a local development server |
| `npm run build` | Creates the optimized production site in `dist/` |
| `npm run preview` | Previews the production build locally |

## Deploy to Vercel later

When the project is pushed to GitHub, import the repository in Vercel. The
included `vercel.json` tells Vercel to use the Vite build and publish the
`dist` folder.
